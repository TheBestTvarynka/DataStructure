All algorithms in this folder take data of grapg from corresponding ".txt" files.

Rules of writing a ".txt" file.

In first line writed number - count of vertex.
>count

Other line have format:
>from to witght

from, to and weight - some corresponding numbers.
Also some algorithms don't need a weight.

Suppose we have graph:

Corresponding ".txt" file:
	11

	1 2 3

	1 6 5

	2 1 3

	2 3 4

	2 6 1
